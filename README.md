## What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

### I’ve learned more about how to control elements using CSS, and my styling skills have improved noticeably. I also learned how to create and manipulate elements directly within JavaScript code, which was very useful and exciting.


## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?

### It took me two days to complete this assignment. I spent around 6 hours each day studying and experimenting with the code. I actually expected it to take longer, but I was able to finish it more efficiently than I thought.
